# Bookshop-client

This project uses React + Typescript + Vite. The template was generated using vite as I described in my chatGpt prompts
It includes a basic setup for a React application with TypeScript, Vite, and ESLint. The project is built  using React 18, Node.js 18 (or Yarn 1.22.19), and Material UI 5 for a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React 18**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript 5**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Material UI 5**: A popular React UI framework that provides pre-built components and styles.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides a development server and optimizes the build process.
- **Axios**: For API calls. A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
